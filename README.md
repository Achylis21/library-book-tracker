# ðŸ“˜ Python Book Library (Practice Project)

This project is a **Python exercise activity** created as part of my learning journey.  
I'm currently learning Python programming using Jupyter Notebooks and LinkedIn Learning.

## ðŸ“š Project Description

This is a simple library system where you can:
- Add books of different genres
- Search for books by title
- Borrow and return books
- View the current state of the library

It uses basic **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Python such as:
- Classes and objects
- Inheritance
- Methods and attributes

## ðŸš§ Disclaimer

This project is **for learning and practice purposes only.**  
It may not follow all best practices yet, but I'm continuously improving as I learn.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Used

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸ’¡ What I'm Learning

- Python syntax and structure
- Object-oriented design
- Using Git and GitHub to manage code
